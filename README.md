👩‍💻 Sandeep | C++ Wizard | Web Dev Explorer 🚀
💡 Writing code that sometimes works, sometimes mocks me.
⚡ Passionate about Game development, Bit Manipulation, and breaking things before fixing them.
🎭 Sarcasm is my default error-handling mechanism.

📌 Tech Stack: C++, JavaScript, Web Dev, DSA, and the occasional existential crisis.
🎮 Currently building a game because debugging real life isn't hard enough.
